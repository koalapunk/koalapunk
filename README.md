Hi! 
This is my personal github repo. And here's what you can expect: /n
Very basic how-do-i-do-this things ❔ /n
Speech-Related pojects (Recognition & Synthesis) 👄 /n
Random artsy projects (this may include art and music) 🎨 /n
Getting into programming games 🎮 /n
And probably poetry-related things 📖 /n

Hope this will actually turn out to be what's promised above, but we'll see 👀
