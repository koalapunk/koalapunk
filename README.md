Hi! 
This is my personal github repo. And here's what you can expect:
Very basic how-do-i-do-this things ❔
Speech-Related pojects (Recognition & Synthesis) 👄
Random artsy projects (this may include art and music) 🎨
Getting into programming games 🎮
And probably poetry-related things 📖

Hope this will actually turn out to be what's promised above, but we'll see 👀
